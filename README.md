## About Homewall <a name="about"></a>

An app **(in development)** to create your own routes on any wall that you can take a picture of!

I wanted to make this app for the following reasons:
1. I wanted to learn about app development and how to code in Dart and use Flutter
2. The most popular app on the climbing market [St≈çkt](https://www.getstokt.com/) has caused me frustration in the past, and it is not free for gyms to use.

### Future Updates

Instead of having user create routes in app I want to use a REST API to call a python file which performs a holddetector see [HoldDetector.py](https://github.com/igorvanloo/HomeWall/blob/main/python/HoldDetector.py). I have already made a fairly accurate Hold Detector using OpenCV.
